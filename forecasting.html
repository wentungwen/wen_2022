                The Shift to Digital: Moving Away from Paper-Based Operations
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Civil Aviation Administration is undergoing a major digital
                transformation in which it plans to move many paper-based
                operations to an online system. The internal and external
                networks of the Civil Aviation Administration cannot currently
                communicate with each other, which means that forecasters must
                use flash drives to transfer data and present it at weather
                forecast meetings. In addition, the approval process for certain
                actions requires the use of multiple stamps and paper copies.
                <br />
                We conducted a total of 7 on-site user interviews and 4 online
                sessions, with approximately 25 participants, including 80
                forecasters from the Meteorological Center and various external
                weather stations, as well as the directors of each station.

                Goal: Integrating Model Display and JMDS for Improved
                Forecasting
              </h3>
              <p>
                For this new UX project, the first step was to thoroughly
                understand the needs and perspectives of our users. Through
                research, I discovered that the Model Display and JMDS systems
                had significant overlap in functions and data sources. While
                JMDS was primarily a data visualization system used for querying
                and sending data, Model Display focused on verifying past
                forecasts through precise calculations and animations. Given the
                available data sources, I decided to integrate Model Display and
                JMDS into a new forecasting system and also build a verification
                system. By considering the unique strengths and capabilities of
                each system, we were able to create a more comprehensive and
                effective solution for our users.

              <h3>A Different Approach: Designing for Internal Users</h3>
              <p>
                There are significant differences between planning an
                information-intensive system for internal use and a public
                product for customers. System users have more specific goals and
                focus on a flexible but clear information architecture,
                including whether it can be effectively understood by users and
                easily expanded in the future. Designing for internal systems
                can be a complex and nuanced process, and it's important to
                carefully consider the unique needs and requirements of the
                users. This presented my first dilemma: Design Thinking was not
                applicable to this project, and I couldn't find guidance online.

                Challenges and Solutions: Designing for Immersive Forecasting
              </h3>
              <p>
                Based on feedback from forecasters after the first round of
                interviews, I developed a basic layout for the web-based system.
                I maximized the most important graph area by making it full
                screen, zoomed the timeline and height axis as much as possible,
                and combined the navbar and toolbar into a single column. These
                design decisions were made to prioritize the key information and
                enhance the usability of the system for the users.

              <h3>Navigation: Improve the flow and hierarchy of the menu</h3>
              <h4>1. Improve the user flow during navigate</h4>
              <p>
                After conducting two more interviews, I found that the
                navigation bar received over 100 clicks per day, but about 80%
                of users complained about the cumbersome process. They had to
                click through three times to display or toggle the navigation
                items. To address this issue, I adopted the following
                strategies:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Positioned the navbar as fixed</li>
                <li>Expanded the options on the right</li>
                <li>Reduced the number of clicks on sub-items</li>
                <li>Made the interaction easier</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                By implementing these changes, we were able to improve the
                usability of the navigation system and enhance the user
                experience.

                <h4>2. Reorganized of Information Hierarchy</h4>
                <p>
                  In addition to improving the flow, I also reorganized the
                  information hierarchy of over 100 products and view options.
                  The first level was the nav-items, the second level was the
                  item category, the third level was the clickable item options,
                  and the fourth level was the color level setting. Users often
                  follow the timeline when switching colors, so I placed the
                  color-setting below the timeline, which was well-received by
                  users. By carefully considering the needs and preferences of
                  our users and organizing the information in a logical and
                  intuitive way, we were able to improve the overall user
                  experience.

                After conducting a five-hour user observation, I found that the
                nav items were used unevenly. For example, users clicked on
                PRODUCT more than 50 times, but only adjusted MAP and DOMAIN a
                few times. According to the forecasters, PRODUCT and VIEWS were
                switched over a hundred times, while the other items were rarely
                adjusted.

                When I first started the project, I was overwhelmed by the sheer
                amount of content and didn't know where to begin. After seeking
                guidance from the UX group, I decided to approach the content
                strategy from both the user and content perspective.

              <h4>Refine and integrate important features</h4>
              <p>
                In order to address the forecasters' concerns about the current
                toolbar, I focused on improving the integration of charts and
                data. I also identified and removed unnecessary functions to
                streamline the tool. By refining the functions and improving the
                overall organization of the content, we were able to create a
                more intuitive and user-friendly experience.

              <p>
                The weather timing diagram is a critical tool, so it is
                important to ensure that it is easy to find and use. Forecasters
                frequently use timing diagrams to view and compare
                meteorological parameters with different forecasting models. To
                make it easier for users to find the information they need, I
                added an airport search box to both the outer interface and the
                diagram area. This allows users to quickly and easily search for
                specific airports and improving the findability and usability.

                For example, the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) needs a
                timeline function that allows users to compare the same time

                  <b>Situation: </b> The current forecasting system only
                  displays data from the latest RUN, which may be incomplete or
                  inaccurate. Users need to switch to previous RUNs to verify
                  the data.

                  <li>
                    For example, a user can set 10/25 00Z on the left window and
                    10/26 00Z on the right window, and then switch between
                    products for comparison.

                    By default, the system only displays the latest 3 RUNs. If a

                Non-Interface Design Challenges: The Importance of Research
                Skills
              </h3>
              <p>
                Improving my research skills can be a valuable asset in any
                field, and non-interface design is no exception, for example:
                the confusing color bar of products. To improve the accuracy of
                data visualization, I tried several approaches, including
                conduct additional user research, consult with fellow experts,
                experiment with different visualization techniques and
                continuously gather feedback from users and iterate on the
                visualizations based on their feedback.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, I believe that design that is based on research and
                evidence, is essential for creating a successful product. By
                following an evidential design process, I can ensure that our
                designs are grounded in the needs and behaviors of our users,
                leading to more intuitive, effective, and user-friendly
                products.
